* Event Loop (node-js style)
** Rough algorithm
*** Check timers, run callbacks for any expired timers
*** Run function on front of queue
*** repeat
** Async I/O
*** grab thread from a thread pool
*** run blocking I/O operation on that thread
*** when I/O finishes, put callback at front of event queue
*** put thread back into pool
